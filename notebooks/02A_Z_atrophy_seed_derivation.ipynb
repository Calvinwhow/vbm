    "The `segments_dict` is a predefined dictionary structured to facilitate the extraction of specific types of neuroimaging files. Each key in the dictionary represents a distinct neuroimaging segment, and its associated value is another dictionary containing the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **path**: This should be filled with the absolute path to the base directory containing the neuroimaging files for the corresponding segment. \n",
    "- **glob_name_pattern**: This is the string pattern that will be used to \"glob\" or search for the specific files within the provided path. It helps in identifying and extracting the desired files based on their naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the segments and their respective fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)\n",
    "- **path**: Absolute path to the base directory containing CSF files.\n",
    "- **glob_name_pattern**: File pattern to search for CSF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Grey Matter\n",
    "- **path**: Absolute path to the base directory containing grey matter files.\n",
    "- **glob_name_pattern**: File pattern to search for grey matter files.\n",
